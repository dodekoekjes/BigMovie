+ tell me (a|another) poem
- Roses are red, violets are blue, \nScrew you.
- I once knew a man who lived in a jar.\nFor a stranger sight you'd have to go far.\nI asked him once why he lived in a jar.\nHe grimaced and said, how bizarre you are.\nMy jar's so cozy, warm and bright,\nEven in the full moonlight.\nThe only drawback is, you see,\nGetting out quickly when I have to pee.
- All doggies go to heaven (or so I've been told). \nThey run and play along the streets of Gold. \nWhy is heaven such a doggie-delight? \nWhy, because there's not a single cat in sight...\n
